    "The goal of this notebook is to create a machine learning pipeline that test multiple base forms (no hyper parameter tuning) of supervised machine learning techniques. This will allow us to determine the best baseline model to then tune in order to maximize performance. We want to set this up in a form that allows us to apply it to many different subsets of our feature space to see what works best and reduce model complexity while maintaining forecasting of out-of-sample data."
